# JREs
# Adoptium originally planned to stop shipping JRE builds in Java 17+, but this decision has been reverted.
# See: https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/issues/2683#issuecomment-999651390
# However, since Java 16 builds are no longer being created, it does not have a JRE available. Instead we will use jlink to build a JRE equivalent ourselves.
